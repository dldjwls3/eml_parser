This webinar will explore how Cloud and Managed Services Providers
(CSPs/MSPs) can optimize and leverage their service delivery to
customers and end-users by using a multi-tenanted, unified monitoring,
and Business Service Management (BSM) platform. We=92ll present how such
platforms reduce MTTR by 80%, provides 24/7 tracking of customers'
critical business services and allows service providers to deliver
greater customer value, customer satisfaction, and revenue.=20


Many service providers are still using multiple monitoring tools that
create silos of data without actionable business intelligence across all
technical and functional domains. By using carrier class end-to-end
approach, these silos of data can be transformed into a single pane of
glass producing a business intelligence layer across the entire IT
environment creating a mature, service-centric, IT organization that can
respond to the dynamic needs of clients and next-gen data centers.=20


KPN, the largest Dutch telecommunications company and one of the largest
cloud and managed services providers in Europe, will be interviewed,
along with Centerity Systems, a Gartner Cool Vendor in IT Operations
Management (ITOM), to discuss next-gen unified monitoring platforms for
complex, hybrid environments (physical, virtual, application, and
cloud).=20

*	Service Providers challenges in modern IT environments
*	How to improve customer satisfaction by meeting their SLA
*	How to reduce operational costs and increase efficiency
*	Compare legacy tools to next-gen, unified, monitoring platforms
*	How to become a mature, service-centric IT organization
*	How BSM can revolutionize delivery
*	New revenue opportunities for MSPs & CSPs
=09
