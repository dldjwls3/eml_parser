[UPCOMING] Planning for Failure: How to Succeed at Detecting Intruders on Y=
our Network <https://information.rapid7.com/Forrester-IntruderDetection.htm=
l?CS=3Dnewsletter>








Date/Time: Friday, February 27th, 11am ET/8am PT

Speakers: Rick Holland, principal analyst at Forrester Research,  Chris Kir=
sch, principal product marketing manager at Rapid7
It=E2=80=99s time to rethink our approach to security. The majority of secu=
rity programs have a plan in place to prevent intruders from getting into t=
he network - but those solutions aren=E2=80=99t working. We need to start d=
etecting intruders when they get past defenses and are on the inside.
Register for this webinar <https://information.rapid7.com/Forrester-Intrude=
rDetection.html?CS=3Dnewsletter> to hear Rick Holland, principal analyst at=
 Forrester Research:


 - Lay out his findings from hundreds of hours of conversations with securi=
ty practitioners and experts
 - Analyze the kill chain and highlight which attacker methodologies organi=
zations should focus on detecting
 - Discuss how the high false positive rate of current monitoring solutions=
 makes triaging of legitimate alerts impossible.



Also, Chris Kirsch, principal product marketing manager at Rapid7, will tal=
k about new ways to leverage intruder analytics on top of existing monitori=
ng solutions to detect intruders early, reduce the false positive rate, and=
 simplify incident investigations.
The webinar will include live Q&A.

News

At the start of the month, the second-largest US health insurance company, =
Anthem, disclosed that it had been compromised by cybercriminals <http://ww=
w.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2015/02/05/why-hackers-are-targeti=
ng-the-medical-sector/>. The attackers collected personal information for u=
p to 80 million current and former Anthem employees and customers, includin=
g Social Security numbers, birthdays and street and e-mail addresses. The c=
ompromise also included medical information numbers, which can be among the=
 most damaging types of stolen data and be used to commit medical fraud. Th=
is attack is just the latest evidence that cybercriminals are increasingly =
targeting the medical sector where they can collect health information that=
 can be sold for a premium on the black market. Attacks against the health =
care industry topped the 2014 breach list compiled by the Identity Theft Re=
source Center <http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ITRC-Surveys-Studies/2014databr=
eaches.html>. Health care companies suffered 42.5% of all data breaches in =
2014, continuing a three-year trend, the survey found.

Anthem members need to be especially wary of criminals trying to "piggyback=
" <http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2015/02/05/anthem-health-care-compute=
r-security-breach/22917635/> onto the hack by using it to launch social eng=
ineering attacks to get their information, said Lee Weiner, senior vice pre=
sident of products and engineering at Rapid7. These would most likely be e-=
mails or phone calls that try to trick worried consumers into sharing confi=
dential information such as financial details. "Consumers should be suspici=
ous of any unsolicited calls or e-mails =E2=80=94 don't click on links, or =
provide personal information over the phone or e-mail. If you get a call, o=
ffer to call back and use your search engine to find the appropriate number=
... Do likewise for any e-mails," he said. The e-mail sent to Anthem customer=
s following the breach only offers a link to the company's site at www.Anth=
emFacts.com <http://www.AnthemFacts.com> and a toll-free number to call, 87=
7-263-7995. Customers are not asked to send in any information. Security pr=
ofessionals and careful consumers that are in the know should make sure oth=
ers are aware of the caution that needs to be involved when dealing with sh=
aring their personal information going forward, particularly in regards to =
the aftermath of this breach.








Community

There=E2=80=99s a one question survey <https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JHDGR=
9F> in the community from the Nexpose team this month. They are looking for=
 some input <https://community.rapid7.com/community/nexpose/blog/2015/02/03=
/moarchecks-a-quick-survey> from the community regarding options for encaps=
ulating service (protocol) fingerprinting data, for example, the content th=
at defines how they recognize=20
that a port is listening for HTTP connections. Nexpose already covers HTTP,=
 so the use here would be adding descriptions of esoteric or proprietary pr=
otocols. Give your input now. <https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/JHDGR9F>

While we=E2=80=99re asking for your ideas, another difficult but important =
challenge we want to help the community solve is how do we de-criminalize s=
ecurity research <https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2015/=
01/26/how-do-we-de-criminalize-security-research-aka-what-s-next-for-the-cf=
aa>? The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) <http://www.law.cornell.edu/to=
pn/computer_fraud_and_abuse_act_of_1986> =E2=80=93 the main anti-hacking la=
w in the US - and a recently proposed update <http://www.whitehouse.gov/sit=
es/default/files/omb/legislative/letters/updated-law-enforcement-tools.pdf>=
, discourage many security researchers from undertaking or disclosing work=
=20
that help us protect our businesses and ourselves from risk. The current wo=
rding of the CFAA creates confusion and doubt for researchers, while also a=
llowing for a very wide margin of prosecutorial discretion in the way the s=
tatute is applied. It contains both criminal and civil actions, the penalti=
es for which are pretty harsh, and increase the severity of the risk for re=
searchers. In order to prevent researchers from being deterred from their i=
mportant work, or punished for it, the security community can and must play=
 a central role in changing these policies for the better. Read the blog po=
st exploring this topic <https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blo=
g/2015/01/26/how-do-we-de-criminalize-security-research-aka-what-s-next-for=
-the-cfaa> to get informed about possibilities for how we can approach this=
 challenge and bring about=20
change.








Security Alert

 Patch Tuesday, February 2015 <https://community.rapid7.com/community/nexpo=
se/blog/2015/02/11/patch-tuesday-february-2015>
For the second straight month Microsoft is holding fast to their blockade o=
f information.  Customers with =E2=80=9CPremier=E2=80=9D support are gettin=
g a very sparse advance notification 24 hours before the advisories drop, a=
nd =E2=80=9CmyBulletins=E2=80=9D continues to be useless because it is not =
updated until well after the patch Tuesday release.  Microsoft called this =
an evolution, and I can certainly see why =E2=80=93 they are applying a squ=
eeze to security teams that will eliminate the weak members of the herd.
This month we are on the receiving end of nine advisories.  The almost ubiq=
uitous critical cumulative patch for all supported versions of Internet Exp=
lorer is back (MS15-009) after a one month hiatus, clearly Microsoft was sa=
ving up from last month because this advisory addresses 41 CVEs including C=
VE-2014-8967 <http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-2014-=
8967> which has been publicly disclosed and CVE-2015-0071 <http://www.cve.m=
itre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-2015-0071> which is under limited t=
argeted attack.
The IE CVE free-for-all is paired up with two critical remote code executio=
n issues affecting all supported versions of Windows, except Server Core va=
riants.  For MS15-010 this includes CVE-2015-0010 <http://www.cve.mitre.org=
/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-2015-0010> which has been publicly disclose=
d and is the probably reason for the Critical designation here, even though=
 over all Microsoft deems this vulnerability as less likely to be exploited=
...  MS15-011 relates to how group policy is applied and is deemed as likely =
to be exploitable.  The three Critical issues will undoubtedly be the patch=
ing priorities due to their public exposure and risk of exploitation.
This month=E2=80=99s fellowship (=E2=80=98cause there are nine, get it?) is=
 rounded out by two Important issues affecting Office or components thereof=
, and three Important ones affecting the majority of supported Windows=20
versions.   Interestingly, MS15-013 with the single CVE-2014-6362 <http://w=
ww.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=3DCVE-2014-6362> is only listed a=
s Important, even though it has been publicly disclosed and exploitation is=
=20
considered likely =E2=80=93 this is probably due to it being =E2=80=9Conly=
=E2=80=9D a Security Feature Bypass, meaning it would have to be used in co=
njunction with some other attack or other information to negatively impact =
a system.  Definitely worth patching any and all Office vulnerabilities as =
they are found.
The curveball this month is MS15-017, which is an Important Elevation of Pr=
ivilege that applies to "Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 20=
12 R2=E2=80=9D (Update Rollup 4).  Hypervisor and Virtual Machine=20
management applications are often overlooked in routine patching  and can b=
e a challenge for Administrators to locate on their network.  Those going t=
o patch may find the system requires an update rollup or other patches prio=
r to this patch being offered, which could hide a vulnerable state.

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">It&rsquo;s time to rethink our approach to security.
          The majority of security programs have a plan in place to prevent intruders from getting into the network - but those solutions aren&rsquo;t working.
          We need to start detecting intruders when they get past defenses and are on the inside.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/iagK0QN6Mxl004000YM2T04"
>Register for this webinar</a> to hear Rick Holland, principal analyst at Forrester Research:</p>
<ul style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">
<li>Lay out his findings from hundreds of hours of conversations with security practitioners and experts</li>
<li>Analyze the kill chain and highlight which attacker methodologies organizations should focus on detecting</li>
<li>Discuss how the high false positive rate of current monitoring solutions makes triaging of legitimate alerts impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Also, Chris Kirsch, principal product marketing manager at Rapid7, will talk about new ways to leverage intruder analytics on top of existing monitoring solutions to detect intruders early, reduce the false positive rate, and simplify     
     incident investigations.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a></a><span style="line-height: 22px;">News</span></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">At the start of the month, the second-largest US health insurance company, Anthem, <a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/z0MY24l0004NQzg6KMc0T00"
>disclosed that it had been compromised 
       by cybercriminals</a>.
        The attackers collected personal information for up to 80 million current and former Anthem employees and customers, including Social Security numbers, birthdays and street and e-mail addresses.
        The compromise also included medical information numbers, which can be among the&nbsp;most damaging types of stolen data and be used to commit medical fraud.
        This attack is just the latest evidence that cybercriminals are increasingly targeting the medical sector where they can collect health information that can be sold for a premium on the black market.
        Attacks against the health care industry topped the 2014 breach list compiled by the <a title="http://www.idtheftcenter.org/ITRC-Surveys-Studies/2014databreaches.html" href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/uAQ000YN4l040d02gMMKT60"
>Identity Theft Resource Center</a>.
        Health care companies suffered 42.5% of all data breaches in 2014, continuing a three-year trend, the survey found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/F6YNl00Be0K0M2gM000T4Q4"
>Anthem members need to be especially wary of criminals trying to "piggyback"</a> onto the hack by using it to launch social      
  engineering attacks to get their information, said Lee Weiner, senior vice president of products and engineering at Rapid7.
        These would most likely be e-mails or phone calls that try to trick worried consumers into sharing confidential information such as financial details.
        "Consumers should be suspicious of any unsolicited calls or e-mails &mdash; don't click on links, or provide personal information over the phone or e-mail.
        If you get a call, offer to call back and use your search engine to find the appropriate number.
        Do likewise for any e-mails," he said.
        The e-mail sent to Anthem customers following the breach only offers a link to the company's site at <a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/HK0020M0QMfYgT40l6N00C4"
>www.AnthemFacts.com</a> and a toll-free number to call, 877-263-7995.
        Customers are not asked to send in any information.
        Security professionals and careful consumers that are in the know should make sure others are aware of the caution that needs to be involved when dealing with sharing their personal information going forward, particularly in regards to the aftermath of this breach.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Community</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">There&rsquo;s a <a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/G6N0Tg20Yg4DK04l0000MQM"
>one question survey</a> in the community from the Nexpose team this month.
        <a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/WK06hQN4l0E2T4M00M0Yg00"
>They are looking for some input</a> from the community regarding options for encapsulating service (protocol) fingerprinting data, for example, the content that defines how they recognize 
that   a      port is listening for HTTP connections.&nbsp;Nexpose already covers HTTP, so the use here would be adding descriptions of esoteric or proprietary protocols.

>Give your input now.</a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">While we&rsquo;re asking for your ideas, another difficult but important challenge we want to help the community solve is <a  href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/b00004NlgKF0TM6i020MY4Q"
>how do we de-criminalize security research</a>? The&nbsp;<a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/E040K0MjNGY0Q0MT2g04l06"
>Computer Fraud and   
     Abuse Act (CFAA)</a> &ndash; the main anti-hacking law in the US - and a <a href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/I060HKY0l4MkQ42M0g0NT00"
>recently proposed update</a>, discourage many security researchers from undertaking or disclosing work 
that        help us protect our businesses and ourselves from risk.
        The current wording of the CFAA creates confusion and doubt for researchers, while also allowing for a very wide margin of prosecutorial discretion in the way the statute is applied.
        It contains both criminal and civil actions, the penalties for which are pretty harsh, and increase the severity of the risk for researchers.&nbsp;In order to prevent researchers from being deterred from their important work, or punished for it, the security community can and must play a   
   central   role in changing these policies for the better.

> <strong>Patch Tuesday, </strong><strong>February 2015</strong></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">For the second straight month Microsoft is holding fast to their blockade of information.&nbsp; Customers with &ldquo;Premier&rdquo; support are getting a very sparse advance notification 24 hours before the advisories drop,    
    and &ldquo;myBulletins&rdquo; continues to be useless because it is not updated until well after the patch Tuesday release.&nbsp; Microsoft called this an evolution, and I can certainly see why &ndash; they are applying a squeeze to security teams that will eliminate the weak members of the    
    herd.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This month we are on the receiving end of nine advisories.&nbsp; The almost ubiquitous critical cumulative patch for all supported versions of Internet Explorer is back (MS15-009) after a one month hiatus, clearly Microsoft was 
       saving up from last month because this advisory addresses 41 CVEs including&nbsp;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/jMmN062lK004Y0MQT4J0g00"
>CVE-2014-8967</a>&nbsp;which has been publicly disclosed and&nbsp;<a class="jive-link-external-small"  href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/f00g40l0YK006N2MKQTnM04"
>CVE-2015-0071</a>&nbsp;which is under limited targeted attack.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The IE CVE free-for-all is paired up with two critical remote code execution issues affecting all supported versions of Windows, except Server Core variants.&nbsp; For MS15-010 this includes&nbsp;<a 
class="jive-link-external-small" href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/z0MY24l0004NQLg6KMo0T00"
>CVE-2015-0010</a>&nbsp;which has been publicly disclosed and is the probably reason for the Critical designation here, even though over all Microsoft deems this vulnerability as less likely to   
     be exploited.&nbsp; MS15-011 relates to how group policy is applied and is deemed as likely to be exploitable.&nbsp; The three Critical issues will undoubtedly be the patching priorities due to their public exposure and risk of exploitation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">This month&rsquo;s fellowship (&lsquo;cause there are nine, get it?) is rounded out by two Important issues affecting Office or components thereof, and three Important ones affecting the majority of supported Windows        
versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly, MS15-013 with the single&nbsp;<a class="jive-link-external-small" href=
"http://info.rapid7.com/E040K0MpNMY0Q0MT2g04l06"
>CVE-2014-6362</a>&nbsp;is only listed as Important, even though it has been publicly disclosed and exploitation is        
considered likely &ndash; this is probably due to it being &ldquo;only&rdquo; a Security Feature Bypass, meaning it would have to be used in conjunction with some other attack or other information to negatively impact a system.&nbsp; Definitely worth patching any and all Office vulnerabilities as  
      they are found.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The curveball this month is MS15-017, which is an Important Elevation of Privilege that applies to "Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 R2&rdquo; (Update Rollup 4).&nbsp; Hypervisor and Virtual Machine        
management applications are often overlooked in routine patching&nbsp; and can be a challenge for Administrators to locate on their network.&nbsp; Those going to patch may find the system requires an update rollup or other patches prior to this patch being offered, which could hide a vulnerable    
    state.</span></p>
