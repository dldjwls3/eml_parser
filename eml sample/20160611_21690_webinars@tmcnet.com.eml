From Shipping Boxes to Delivering Software-Driven Value to Customers

Live Webinar Featuring IDC and Juniper Networks =97June 16, 11 am (EDT) =

3 pm (GMT)=20

Date:  Thursday, June 16th   Time: 11 AM EST.

Registration Link:
http://www5.gemalto.com/juniper-idc-software-driven-value-webinar

Join us for Gemalto=92s second Ask the Experts session of the year,
featuring Amy Konary - Research VP Software Licensing and Provisioning
at IDC and Mark Seery, Sr Director, Strategy and Corp Development, at
Juniper Networks. This live webinar will look at how cloud and
virtualization are expediting the adoption of software business models
and what this means for intelligent device vendors and software
providers.=20

For a long time now, many product or device-oriented companies have been
attempting to shift the primary focus of their business from shipping
boxes to delivering positive outcomes for customers. The success of this
approach typically involves a transition to new business models that
rely more heavily on software to help cultivate customer relationships
and future-proof business processes. This webinar will focus on
strategies for using software business models and monetization
approaches to successfully launch or grow innovative businesses.=20

 <http://www5.gemalto.com/juniper-idc-software-driven-value-webinar>=20

Key questions answered will include:


*	What are the key forces driving this transformation?
*	Which key business model elements must be in place?
*	How are software and service supply chains fundamentally
different from traditional product supply chains?
*	What technology considerations should I focus on to enable this
business?
*	Who are the top 3 stakeholders within my organization and how
should they adapt to this transformation?

For many companies in the midst of this kind of transformation, one of
the biggest challenges is getting the buy-in from the various internal
stakeholders. Unless a company=92s management recognizes the new =
business
as a growth engine that is key to its future health, it will be hard to
get the support needed for a successful transition. Mark Seery, Sr
Director, Strategy and Corp Development at Juniper, will talk about his
company=92s efforts in moving from a hardware to software-centric =
business
and his overall vision for where Juniper is heading.
