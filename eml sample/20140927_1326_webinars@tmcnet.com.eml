Enterprises across the globe are increasingly adopting mobile solutions.
Without the proper security measures in place, however, these companies
risk data leakage, malware infections, and data loss. Successful
mobility deployments require a firm understanding of the security risks
=96 and the solutions that are available to combat them.

Historically, mobile device management (MDM) has offered the best
solution. But in this fast changing mobile world, new technologies are
emerging. IT departments are now armed with valuable tools to apply more
granular policies that secure the apps and content residing on managed
and unmanaged devices. This ultimately enables organizations to provide
superior =96 and secure =96 mobile experiences to employees, business
partners, and customers. =20

Join this webinar for a lively discussion with Forrester=92s senior =
mobile
security analyst Tyler Shields, SAP=92s head of mobile security Senthil
Krishnapillai and Sun Products=92 IT operations manager John Major. In
this session you will learn:

*	The new risks facing today=92s enterprises as they expand mobile
deployments
*	What has changed in the past two years and why now is the time
to reconsider your strategy
*	How to evaluate the new technologies available and make the best
decision for a secure future
*	How to secure application and data across all managed and
unmanaged devices

Who should attend:

*	IT administrators, directors, CIOs
*	Mobile security experts
*	IT security experts
*	Mobile strategy execs
