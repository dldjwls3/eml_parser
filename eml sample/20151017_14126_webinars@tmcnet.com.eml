The Employee Setup application is a modern enterprise app that makes it
easy to onboard new employees by automating onboarding beyond HR.  As a
compliment to your core HRIS system (ADP, Workday, Oracle,
HCM/PeopleSoft, etc.), the app is designed to automate and streamline
the process of setting up a new employee upon agreement of employment,
with established work item requirements, while reducing the
time-to-productivity. The purpose of the application is to automate the
manual checklist/tasks managers use when a new hire comes on board,
ensuring nothing gets overlooked or delayed, in turn, increasing the
level of productivity and employee retention.

The app will provide the ability to clearly align new hires with key
business strategies, while standardizing and individualizing new hire
elements. The Employee Setup App is ideal for organizations with a high
volume of new hires annually, or with high turnover, and enables high
efficiency, productivity, and compliance.=20

solution
built on the Intellect Platform, and offers customization and
integration functionalities. The Intellect BPM Platform empowers
everyone to innovate by giving people the ability to build and deploy a
wide variety of enterprise business apps rapidly, without the need for
programming from design to launch. With Intellect=92s agile development
methodology, users are enabled to easily create web-based enterprise
apps with smart forms, integrated enterprise data, automated workflow,
advanced reporting capabilities, and the ability to go mobile in just
minutes.
