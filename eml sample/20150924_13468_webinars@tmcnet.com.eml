WEBINAR: Customer Engagement Center in 30 minutes
How the Customer Engagement Center can increase sales, improve client's
loyalty, and adapt to your customer. 

Tuesday September 29, 2015 TIME: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT


Customer Engagement Centers (CECs) are much more than mere multi-channel
contact centers. They are considered to be the next 
generation set of solutions to be implemented on customer service areas.
Although this concept was developed several decades ago, 
it is much more important now, due to the complexity of managing clients
in an Omnichannel environment. 

New generations, and hence customers, are evolving into native
multichannel users, but this concept is much more than managing 
multichannel. It is the capability to understand the customer context
and identify the customer on every single interaction, comprehend 
why each customer interacts with the organization, and build a detailed
profile based on preferences, issues, purchases, use of 
products, or even personality. It is necessary to define a personalized
relationship strategy and processes to engage each individual 
customer with the customer service team with a successful outcome that
will increase your company sales, covert customers into 
prescribers, improve your client's loyalty, and leverage the information
you have on your customer to adapt to their preferences.

Who should attend: 

*	COO's
*	Contact Center Managers
*	Customer service Managers
*	CIO's
*	CTO's
*	CFO's

Join us on this webinar and learn how to engage your customers.
