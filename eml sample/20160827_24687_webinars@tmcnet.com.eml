Why are you constantly spending time and money training people on your
communications platform? Why does it seem like people are reluctant to
upgrade to new communications features that are readily available to
them? These questions and more come down to how easy or difficult it is
for someone to use your communications technology.=20

We are in a time where consumers have become accustomed to intuitive
design that doesn=92t take much training and fits into their current way
of doing things. However, when this mentality is taken from a =
consumer=92s
personal life and applied to an office environment, we can see many of
the technologies that employees are given are often not designed with
usability in mind. Instead, employees have to conform to the way the
technology dictates things must be done. If the end-users of your Hosted
PBX or Unified Communications services find it difficult or inconvenient
to work with your solution, this will lead to low adoption rates within
their organization and overall frustration with your company itself.
This also applies to your employees as well! If your team is working
with a communications platform that is intuitive in design and easy to
use, they are more efficient and effective in driving value to your
business.=20
