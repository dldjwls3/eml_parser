 	 Initiatives such as cloud computing,  SaaS-based applications
and distributed data analysis are imposing significant security risks on
corporate, network, IT and business workflows. As a result, companies
are looking at technologies and strategies to assure security while
delivering the required cloud-based services. How do businesses maintain
control and ownership of sensitive data as it moves fluidly across IT
and organizational boundaries?  To protect this data and meet compliance
requirements, security approaches must evolve to protect the data itself
as opposed to just putting walls around infrastructure.=20

Fortunately, cloud computing and SaaS-based applications don=92t need to
be high-risk security propositions.  By considering security as an
enabler, instead of an obstacle for cloud adoption, you can protect
data, mitigate risks and achieve compliance across the cloud while
maximizing business potential. During this webcast we will illustrate
how data-centric security will help you assure data protection for
sensitive cloud-based corporate data.=20

What Attendees will learn:

*	Steps and safeguards to protect data when making the move to the
cloud=20
*	How encryption can play a role in protecting sensitive Cloud
Data=20
*	Ways to leverage cloud data protection=20

Who should attend:

*	CIO, CISO, CTO, Security and Risk Professionals
