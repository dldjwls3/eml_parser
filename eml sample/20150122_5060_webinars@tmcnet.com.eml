Join us tomorrow...

You've probably heard that Dyn and TMCnet will be hosting a webinar
called 
WEBINAR: Maximize Website Availability & Performance through Cloud Load
Balancing 
Thursday January 22, 2015 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT/ 7:00 PM GMT
Register Now!
<http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=920689&s=1&k=4C9A06BFEFC53BF17B2B8ADED2FC
1EAB&partnerref=tmcmodemail> 


Rapid growth in traffic can challenge even the best websites. When even
a brief outage can cost you thousands 
of customers, you need to ensure your Cloud deployment is flexible and
bulletproof. Cloud Load Balancing is a 
strategy to manage online traffic by distributing workloads across
multiple servers and resources. 

Scott Hilton, Executive Vice President of Products at Dyn and Rohit
Mehra, Vice President of Network Infrastructure
at IDC, will explore the benefits of Cloud Load Balancing and CDN Load
Balancing to maximize website availability 
and performance. The webinar will also examine how Dyn Traffic
Management can create a resilient, high availability 
solution spread across multiple Cloud providers.

What Attendees will learn:


*	Why rapid growth websites and businesses running
mission-critical applications in the Cloud need to consider 
	Cloud Load Balancing 
*	Fundamental load balancing strategies 
*	Turning 99.9% uptime into 99.999% uptime using cloud-based load
balancing 
*	How to circumvent CDN outages and optimize performance
