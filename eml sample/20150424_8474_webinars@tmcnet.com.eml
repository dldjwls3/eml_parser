 	 As carrier networks evolve to handle new IP services, the
signaling requirements also change. The signaling infrastructure must
support the next-generation IP and other new services enabled by
DIAMETER, while also interworking with legacy protocols in SS7, ENUM,
DNS, Radius and with the IMS core and SIP. Today, many carriers are
looking specifically for STP, Number Portability and DIAMETER supported
within a common platform, using a common database structure, and have
few options.=20

NetNumber TITAN is transforming how carriers architect their core
networks for next-generation services. A centralized signaling and
routing control (CSRC) platform that supports many network functions,
such as TITAN, best enables a carrier to get to market faster, reduce
OPEX investment, and simplifying the underlying signaling and routing
layers.

What Attendees will learn:

*	How the paradigm shift to Centralized Signaling and Routing
Control (CSRC) with multiple applications running on a common platform
will simplify the transition from TDM to IP
*	What should carriers look for in an integrated platform with
STP, Number Portability and DIAMETER
*	How the integrated control actions of centralized provision and
distributed user data within the CSRC model contributes to structural
simplification and lower costs in the OSS/BSS layers

Who should attend:

*	Network architects at Mobile and Fixed carriers
*	Carrier CIOs and CTOs
*	Network technology press and analysts

complex service-control problem faced by all communications service
providers. Finding a way to take a complex technical subject and make it
easy to understand is one of his greatest strengths.=20

Ranalli=92s ability to look at a highly complex system and identify ways
to simplify the environment has led him to found several successful
companies including Fax International, an international fax-over-IP
service provider, and Student Life, a magazine for college students that
