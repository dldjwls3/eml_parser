Supporting a Growing Mobile Workforce with Cloud Communications=20

Tuesday October 20, 2015=20
TIME: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT=20
=09


The modern workforce is growing faster than we=92ve ever seen before due
to the rise in mobile device usage, bring your own devices (BYOD) and
the continued virtualization of organizations to the cloud. Small
businesses in particular are benefiting from a mobile workforce making
it possible to compete against larger businesses with bigger IT budgets.
It is estimated that 75% of the workforce in the US is already mobile
and IDC predicts that by 2015 the numbers, worldwide, will reach 1.3
billion or a staggering 37.2% of global workforce. =20

Daryl Reva, VP of Cloud Marketing will discuss the importance of cloud
communications in supporting this shift and how to support an ever
growing and dynamic mobile workforce.
