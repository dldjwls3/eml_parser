in an electronic format* with a large majority of electronic information
remaining in electronic format, that is, never printed. Thus,
enterprises are archiving large amounts of electronic data, much of
which is in the form of emails and associated attachments. Email, the
number one application deployed by global enterprises, is often a
preferred way to communicate internally and externally. Most businesses
know that sensitive customer and patient information must be protected
and securely archived for legal and audit purposes, =96 both of which =
are
increasing. In this situation, the presence of an integrated eDiscovery
solution becomes more critical than ever.

In this webinar you will learn how to protect your enterprise
communications with data-centric email encryption, while allowing easy
access to the archived secure emails and attachments in the event of
legal or audit requests. Learn how advances in eDiscovery enable
protected emails to be easily accessed and managed. Learn why ease of
use, deployment and administration are fundamental to email security
success across a global enterprise and how email encryption can become a
strategic business enabler.=20
