The total cost of ownership (TCO) debate between a premises and cloud
decision continues to wage on. Depending on how you look at it, it seems
that you arrive at a different conclusion. However, the missing factor
in nearly all cloud contact center and unified communications TCO
discussions is the consideration of buyer risk. In this 90 minute web
event, Dave Michaels, Principal Analyst, TalkingPointz and Tim Passios,
Interactive Intelligence vice president of solutions marketing will
discuss this very topic =97 how =93built-in=94 obsolescence can affect a
premises-based purchase; what if your business model changes and you
need to make a technology change; where are you if there is a
significant downturn in the economy; what if your selected vendor
doesn=92t keep up competitively? These and dozens of other risks are =
often
ignored in the TCO evaluation, sometimes leaving a well-intentioned
buyer left with no way out aside from an expensive write-off and a new
project to begin. A move to the cloud can eliminate the risk that the
buyer assumes =97 and when calculated into the equation, can have a
profound impact on the true TCO. Join us to learn the in=92s-and-out=92s =
of
building a reduced risk TCO model.

Following the presentation, there will be an extensive Q&A session where
Passios and Michels will be joined by industry veteran Jon Arnold,
Principal, J Arnold & Associates to answer live audience questions.=20
