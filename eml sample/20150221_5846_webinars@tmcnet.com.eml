 	 Today, Mobile Operators (and Telcos, in general) are losing
significant revenues to Over-The-Top and Non-Traditional providers that
offer no- or low-cost and feature-rich alternatives to the traditional
voice/video/messaging services traditionally offered by Telcos. As a
result, Telcos are facing new pressures to redefine themselves and
compete effectively with these providers to increase their revenues.

Telecom APIs (which include Service APIs, Data APIs and Network APIs)
that expose their infrastructure in a controlled manner to third party
services promise to be the magic bullet that unleashes the tremendous
revenue potential of digital services and allow Telcos to effectively
compete with Over-The-Top and Non-Traditional providers. We are calling
this trend the API-fication of the Telco network.

In this webinar, we will discuss:=20

*	the API-fication of the Telco network
*	how Telcos can evolve their network to capitalize on the
API-fication trend
*	the specific areas of the network where API-fication is gaining
traction
*	specific case studies of Telcos generating new revenues through
API-fication=20

What Attendees will learn:

*	The API-fication trend in Telco networks=20
*	Areas and Market Segments where there is lot of acitivity
*	How to make money through Telco APIs

Who should attend:

*	Mobile Operators =96 Marketing/Services/Operations Groups
*	Telco Industry consultants
*	Industry Analysts
