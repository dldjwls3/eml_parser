 	 Take back Q3 productivity with cloud communications=20

No matter how hard we try, Q3 production slows down with summer BBQs,
vacations and long weekends. In a Captivate study found that workforce
attendance worsens 19 percent in the summer months. However, for today's
workforce, there are few reasons for employees to be in a physical
office location. Anyone with a stable Internet connection, mobile phone
and laptop is a ready-to-work team member.=20

In this free, 45-minute webinar, learn how with one log-in, team members
can access the power of contextual intelligence, SMS business texting,
and more from their home office (or the grill). To put managers at ease,
cloud communications delivers beachside access to calling analytics and
IM/presence. Reclaim the summer and get your Q3 numbers back on track.

What Attendees will learn:

*	How to foster a collaborative and disparate team
*	How to connect remote employees in a meaningful way
*	How to provide actionable insights to management and employees

Who should attend:

*	Sales leaders and managers
*	IT leaders
*	Project managers=20
