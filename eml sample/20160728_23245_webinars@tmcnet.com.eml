WEBINAR: You're Doing It Wrong!=20
Why You Shouldn't Be Paying Per-Seat/ Per-Feature for Hosted PBX
Thursday, July 28, 2016 TIME: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT=20


Technology decision makers are tasked with finding feature-rich
communications solutions at a reasonable price point.=20
Unfortunately, this is something often easier said than done. The most
common pricing model for a Hosted PBX solution is
one where you must pay your vendor for every user that will be on your
system. This strategy of =93per-seat pricing=94 has been=20
accepted by services providers and large enterprises as standard,
however, there are many drawbacks to this type of pricing=20
that directly limits ROI. Many vendors also use per-feature pricing
which allows them to charge you for any features that you=20
may want to use outside of their basic product package.=20

This webinar
<http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=3D1216501&s=3D1&k=3DD127E0F92703A32386330D=
16DA1
4061B&partnerref=3Dtmcmod>  will discuss the downfalls of the per-seat =
and
per-feature=20
pricing models and will provide an alternative solution.=20


What attendees will learn:

*	The basics of per-seat/per feature pricing
*	How per-seat/ per-feature pricing can limit your profitability=20
*	How a concurrent call pricing model benefits service providers
and enterprises
*	Real world ROI comparisons of per-seat pricing v.s. concurrent
call pricing
*	The NetSapiens Pricing Model- Universal Session License
