VoLTE and Virtualization are gaining traction with many global launches
and many more forecasted in coming years. While the excitement
continues, mobile service providers have a real challenge on hand =96 =
How
to ensure the end-to-end quality of experience that VoLTE promises is
realized.=20


To ensure consistent user experience, mobile services providers must
provide high-definition communications services by assuring end-to-end
IP connectivity and roaming. As service providers move to an all IP
network, it is critical to mitigate new challenges such as security
threats, signaling and media interoperability, new VoLTE roaming
architectures, and migration to an all virtual NFV infrastructure to
achieve service agility, operational simplicity, and dynamic
scalability.=20
