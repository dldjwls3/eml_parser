The era of subscription commerce has arrived. Companies are increasingly
focused on generating recurring revenues by offering subscription-based
services and business models. As the marketplace is seeing an
exponential increase in the complexity of product mixes, enterprises are
finding that existing transaction-based systems are unable to support
the move from physical to digital goods and services. Powerful billing
and revenue management capabilities are both critical and strategic for
enterprises to be successful in this new age of subscription commerce.

What attendees will learn:

*	What=92s driving subscription commerce and what capabilities are
required for the NOW economy.
*	Pathways, deployment models and considerations for cloud billing
*	How cloud billing can deliver new subscription services quickly
and cost-effectively, provide real-time views of your customer base, and
achieve financial compliance.

Who should attend:

*	Marketing executives looking to create profitable recurring
revenue streams and develop smarter ways to price and bundle products
*	Finance executives charged with achieving Sarbanes-Oxley, GAAP
and PCI compliance
*	IT executives interested in reducing costs, complexity and risks
by deploying cloud based billing =20
