It's no secret that mobile technology has revolutionized the way
consumers conduct their lives. Mobile technology has become ubiquitous,
influencing the business workplace and workforce. Last year, IDC
predicted that 75% of the US and nearly 40% of the global workforce
would be mobile and signs indicate that the rate of mobile growth is
only being accelerated by the advancement of cloud technology, improved
security, and more reliable network access. 

What you'll learn:

*	The trends that are driving change in the business
communications industry
*	The changing ways end users operate thanks to developments in
mobility and communication vehicles
*	The impact of bring your own device (BYOD) and smart phones for
remote workers
*	Understanding what the cloud is for the mobile workforce

Who should attend?

*	Information Technology management (Director/Manager/Leads)
*	Small and Medium size business owners or anyone with an
influence on workforce experience and technology strategy
