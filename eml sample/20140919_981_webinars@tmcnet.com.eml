Let=92s face it, consumers don=92t like IVRs.  According to a JD Power &
Associates study, the IVR accounts for an astounding 27% of the total
call experience.=20
However, only 7% of organizations currently offer an IVR solution that
delivers a better experience than their live agent experience.

This causes a major headache for financial service companies who take
hundreds or thousands of calls daily. Customers want to obtain
information, transact, or=20
make requests as quickly and painlessly as possible, but calls handled
by agents can be incredibly expensive. Consumers dislike IVRs because of
a history of IVRs=20
being cumbersome and time consuming. However, it IS possible to build an
IVR that customers not only use, but prefer it to human interactions
because it actually=20
saves them time, produces the resolutions they are seeking, and is easy
and effective.

According to Gartner, by 2020, the customer will manage 85% of the
relationship with an enterprise without interacting with a human.=20
