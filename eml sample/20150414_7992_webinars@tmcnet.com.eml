A Case Study On How To Build A Sustainable Storage Infrastructure=20

Thursday, April 16th
TIME: 9:30am PST/ 12:30pm EST=20
=09

 	=20

At BYU - Hawaii, the staff were getting frustrated with sluggish
systems. The University had already upgraded servers and infrastructure
but did not realize any perceived increase in speed when accessing data
systems. Luckily the school was coming up on its five-year storage
replacement cycle. The goal was to invest in a modern storage system,
utilizing newer technologies that could handle the increasing demands
for performance and capacity without excessive expense. The system had
to be very intuitive and VMware friendly.

Join R. Neal Moss, BYU =97 Hawaii=92s systems and network analyst for IT
infrastructure, and guest speaker Henry Baltazar, senior analyst at
Forrester Research, as they discuss how the university overcame its
storage challenges and share advice on what you can do to build a
sustainable storage infrastructure.
