How does your schedule look?...

This is the event you don't want to miss, Securosis, HPE Security and
TMCnet will be hosting a webinar this Thursday

WEBINAR: Evolving Encryption Key Management Best Practices for the Data
Center 
Thursday, October 20, 2016 TIME: 1:00pm ET/10:00am PT


Today there is greater demand for encryption in more locations in our
data stacks -- which now span physical environments, virtual
environments, 
and increasing barriers even within our traditional environments.
Simultaneously, compliance and internal needs also increase the need for
compartmentalization and separation of keys, without increasing costs or
complexity. Encryption keys must be managed and distributed in 
ever-more-complex scenarios, such as centralizing enterprise keys, while
supporting remote business units encrypting storage locally. 

Join Securosis and HPE Security
<http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1273834&s=1&k=669FF0B03AB7E6876189A0F88D2
9891A&partnerref=tmcinvite>  as we summarize independent research
highlighting emerging best practices for managing encryption keys for 
protecting data-at-rest in the face of these new challenges. 

We'll discuss: 

*	how key management practices are changing to keep pace
*	how to provide the right key, at the right time and location,
without compromising security 

Finally hear how HPE Enterprise Secure Key Manager (ESKM) can be
leveraged to help solve these challenges, providing one of the most
certified, 
validated, and trusted key management solutions today.
