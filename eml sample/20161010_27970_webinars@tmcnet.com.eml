Business is an increasingly quick and competitive beast, so
organizations need to become leaner and more agile to survive and thrive
in the business world. It is the new Digital World we must deliver to
customers and citizens.=20

Unified communications, collaboration, and contact centers can go a long
way to help them accomplish this =96 by enabling employees and teams to =
be
more productive, more mobile, more responsive, and more innovative. The
way customers interact with your business is the first, last, and only
line of defense in an increasingly competitive world. They demand
companies be there when they call, text, or message them, and they
better engage with businesses that reach out to them in the most
convenient ways and at the ideal times. Indeed, in today's world,
customer experience is everything.=20

At the same time, UC solutions can be used to ensure citizens and
customers have the most current information to keep them safe and
informed, are in control so they can easily get the answers and help
they're looking for, and within reach so businesses can let them know
how much they are valued.=20

All of the above applies in general office, financial, government,
health care, hospitality, retail, and a wide range of other
environments.=20

Delivering these solutions requires applications and services as well as
underlying networks that can ensure these solutions deliver the intended
user experiences.=20

automated networking infrastructure can significantly change both
business and customer/citizens outcomes=20
*	How smart industry solutions can address an array of verticals
and use cases =96 from office efficiency, to customer service in the =
bank
and hospitality verticals, to public safety
*	Why fabric based software-defined networking is the best
underlying architecture to underpin these services and capabilities

*	C-Suite Executives
