Achieving Availability and Resiliency in OpenStack Telco Networks=20

Tuesday May 26, 2015
TIME: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT=20
=09

 	=20

OpenStack has been selected as the cloud platform of choice by most
Telcos for NFV. While OpenStack supports basic levels of availability it
does not support service continuity and stateful fault tolerance. This
is a major concern for the Telcos. By inserting a Virtualized Cloud
Resilience Layer that transparently brings Telco reliability to any
cloud application, Telcos can use OpenStack with the confidence that any
application can be deployed with selectable levels of availability,
including stateful fault tolerant with geo-redundancy, without required
code changes.

What Attendees will learn:

*	How to achieve transparent service continuity with fully
stateful fault tolerance with Geo-Redundancy, with no required code
changes, in an OpenStack environment
*	How to fully automate a cloud workload environment, with
selectable levels of availability, for all applications including
control and forwarding planes with different latency requirements
*	How to transform Telco network equipment efficiency from the
traditional 45% utilization towards a model that provides 80% to 90%
utilization

Who should attend:

*	Telco Network architects and strategist for NFV and SDN
*	VNF developers
*	Telco Cloud developers and enthusiasts
