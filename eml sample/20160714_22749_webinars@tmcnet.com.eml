The cloud=92s promise of on-demand functionality for a lower cost has
arrived to business applications. The use of Microsoft Office 365 across
the globe is growing rapidly, with a clear value proposition to
re-invent productivity for organizations of all sizes. But the
transition to the cloud is not without challenges.=20

Privacy, compliance and security concerns arise to corporations that
deal extensively with sensitive personal data. The limitations Office
365 has in this area for certain corporations can be addressed through
the use of end-to-end encryption for all e-mails and files sent to
Office 365.

In this webinar you will learn:=20

*	The steps for Office 365 migration.
*	Security and privacy pitfalls that could arise in a cloud
environment.
*	How can end-to-end e-mail encryption give you peace of mind in
the cloud?

HPE SecureMail is the most widely deployed end-to-end email encryption
solution in the world and is a perfect fit for corporations that want to
ensure complete protection to their most sensitive information in their
transition to the cloud. HPE SecureMail integrates seamlessly with
Office 365 enhancing its security, privacy and usability capabilities.
