Are you hearing more and more about DNS and wondering what you are
missing? Isn't DNS one of those "set it and forget it" infrastructure
must haves? Under many situations, without DNS, your users can't reach
your online assets, so they can't complete transactions, and you don't
make money. This is true whether users are customers, employees, or
partners. In today's complex infrastructure, DNS has everything to do
with business continuity and protecting your revenue stream.
