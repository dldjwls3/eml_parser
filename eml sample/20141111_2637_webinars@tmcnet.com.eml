You've probably heard that Interactive Intelligence and TMCnet will be
hosting a webinar Tomorrow at 11:30am ET

WEBINAR: Improve Patient Engagement and Profitability: Embrace
Consumerism and New Technology
Tuesday November 11, 2014 TIME: 11:300pm ET/ 16:30 GMT


Legislation isn't the only thing triggering change in the U.S.
healthcare industry. What's really causing healthcare providers to
rethink how they 
do businesses is consumerism. Patients are now customers first. Their
expectations for service are much higher. And given the new landscape 
of competition, healthcare providers are feeling the pressure to
differentiate themselves through outreach, patient engagement and
customer 
care - "all personalized."

This webcast for healthcare technology, operations, and contact center
managers spotlights the technologies and best practices that can make 
customer interactions more patient-centric and cost-effective. We've
even scheduled three industry authorities to discuss them.

*	Nancy Jamison, Principal Analyst, Information and Communication
Technologies with Frost & Sullivan. Nancy will discuss key trends
impacting 
	healthcare providers, and how technology can make providers
actual trendsetters.
	
	
*	Bill Ramalho, CIO/CTO of Fairfax Family Practice Centers and
Virginia Surgery Associates, two leading medical care providers in
Northern Virginia. 
	Bill will share the four core principles of his organization's
solution philosophy, and how contact center and business process
automation have helped 
	improve profitability, outreach and patient engagement. This
philosophy continues to position the organization strongly in the
current healthcare 
	delivery environment. 
	
	
*	Rachel Wentink, Senior Director, Business Automation Group for
Interactive Intelligence. Rachel will share more customer use cases
where providers 
	have integrated the contact center platform with core systems
like Epic to deliver personalized, cost-effective outreach and
self-service
