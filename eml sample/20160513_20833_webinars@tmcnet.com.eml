What does it mean to have an enterprise-grade cloud communications
solution? Many providers may claim to offer it, but not all can deliver.
And if always-on, reliable and global communications are
mission-critical for your business, you need to ensure your cloud
provider is making the "grade".

In this webinar
<http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=3D1153582&s=3D1&k=3DABB3FB366F7301815DAFE0=
B84B2
F0222&partnerref=3Dtmclanding> , we will discuss 8 standard elements =
that
all companies should look out for when exploring a cloud communications
solution, including:

*	The flexibility to extend international services and global
reach
*	Potential risks of downtime and non-compliance when solutions
are not enterprise-grade
*	The ability to integrate with contact center, CRM and
productivity applications

Who should attend:

*	CIO=92s, Directors of IT or Infrastructure
*	Anyone interested in unifying their communications and
collaboration infrastructure onto a single, secure, reliable platform =
=96
simply.
*	Those seeking a way to replace outdated or disparate legacy
systems across multiple locations
