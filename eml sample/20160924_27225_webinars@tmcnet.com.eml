WEBINAR: Combining Artificial Intelligence With Human Intelligence
Tuesday, September 27, 2016 TIME: 12:00pm ET/ 9:00am PT


Real improvements in automatic speech recognition accuracy and natural
language processing technologies have surfaced in the past decade, 
yet flawless performance is still a goal, leaving many consumers of
speech technology unsatisfied. 

While automation is key for scale and delivery convenience for customer
support and virtual assistance, it is simply not enough to ensure 
reliable performance. 

This talk discusses strategies for combining human assistance with
automated service delivery paradigms to provide users with reliable
speech services.
