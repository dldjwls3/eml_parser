How do you differentiate yourself from your competition?...

hosting a webinar Tomorrow

WEBINAR: Comparing Apples to Oranges: Disruptive Pricing Strategies For
Service Providers
Tuesday, October 25, 2016 TIME: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT


How do you differentiate yourself from your competition? If your answer
to this question does not include pricing, you might want to 
re-think your strategy. One of the most effective tools that a service
provider can use to stand out is a unique pricing model tailored to 
their target market. In a sea of similarly packaged and priced products,
a disruptive pricing model can be the difference between keeping 
up with the competition and jumping ahead of the pack. 

This webinar will help you stay away from common pricing mistakes and
form a unique pricing strategy to set you apart from your competition. 


What attendees will learn:

*	The current state of the service provider market
*	Common/Current pricing strategies in the service provider space
*	Common pricing mistakes
*	How to differentiate with a disruptive pricing model
*	What type of pricing model is right for your business
*	How the vendors you work with can affect your pricing model
