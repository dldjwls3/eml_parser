Exploring the Four Stages to Virtualization and the Impact of Real-Time
Applications=20

Thursday, December 11, 2014
Time: 2:00pm ET/ 11:00am PT=20

Enterprise networking administrators continue to face pressures to
reduce TCO, increase service levels, manage sprawl, control IT, and
improve business-to-IT alignment.  To address these needs, they are
increasingly turning to virtualization to consolidate hardware assets,
reduce administrative effort and achieve better ROI.

To successfully virtualize any part of their environment, IT
professionals must understand the unique needs of real-time applications
=96 including instant messaging, texting, audio and video conferencing,
call control, and of course, voice =96 and the broad range of hosting =
and
servicing options available for these applications. =20
