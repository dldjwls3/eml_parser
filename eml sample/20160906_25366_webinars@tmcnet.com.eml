WEBINAR: The Secrets of Staying Ahead of the Bad Guys
Thursday, September 8, 2016 TIME: 1:00pm ET/ 10:00am PT


With continued improvements in payments security through technologies
such as P2PE and EMV, the PCI community has been effective at 
combating crime in a wide variety of traditional retail environments. As
the use of stolen or fraudulent cards for in-person transactions becomes
more difficult, however, criminals are increasingly shifting their focus
to online activities, and the rapidly growing mobile payment sector. To
stay 
ahead of the bad guys, merchants need solutions that are designed to
reliably protect payment data within their environment, and reduce PCI 
scope without impacting business processes.  

Join us Thursday
<http://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1246013&s=1&k=1FBD77733258E76F6875F07592F
0A8B9&partnerref=tmccustom>  to learn why any business that wants to
remove sensitive data from their databases should understand these
strategies on how 
they can eliminate exposure to cardholder data, reduce risks and PCI
audit costs.  

You will learn:

*	How the threat landscape is evolving
*	What the attackers are doing differently 
*	How to stay ahead of cyber thieves, while neutralizing the risk
of payment data breaches
*	What is necessary to secure all e-commerce and mobile
transactions 
*	How to enable innovation and business growth while maintaining
strong data protection
