Understanding Security Tokenization and PCI Compliance 

Wednesday May 20, 2015
TIME: 1:00PM ET/ 10:00AM PT 
	


Consumer-facing organizations of all types face increasing IT complexity
and a future where more applications will have PANs, tokens, and payment
tokens flowing in the system. Understanding tokenization is critical to
the security of applications, and to having solid justification for
reducing audit scope in a tokenized environment. 

With newer methods of tokenization such as Apple Pay gaining ground in
the marketplace, there is a need to develop deeper technical and
architectural understanding of the available methods of protecting PAN
data, and how security tokenization fits from the perspective of the
end-to-end architecture of payments ecosystems.

In this session our experts will explain how the tokenization system is
secured within the network and how it maps tokens into PANs. Attendees
will learn:

*	The latest on PCI 3.0 and updates related to SSL and TLS
encryption protocols and vulnerabilities that can put payment data at
risk,
*	Security and PCI-related aspects of payment vs. security
tokenization in user networks, and 
*	Gain a deeper understanding of standards and options for
protecting PAN data in multi-platform enterprise environments.
